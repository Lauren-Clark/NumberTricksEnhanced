		/* Name: Lauren Clark
		Date: February 4 2021

		Goal 
		Have user enter a number, preform calculations on the input number involving a series of arthematic formulas and variables
		and have the final answer come out to 7*/

		/*Algorithm
		Script 1:
		1. Create variable to represent the entry for the first prompt
		2. Create prompt that asks user to give a number and set that entry to new variable
		4. Create variables that represent each arthimetic forumla needed, starting with startingNumber
		5. I used different variables instead of re-assigning startingNumber over and over
		6. The final answer is determined as the sixth's number's calculation
		
		Script 2 (in body)
		7. I use document.write to have JS write the header
		8. Then I used document.write to have JS write out the arthimetic operations happening with the variables
		that were defined in Script 1. These strings are added together using cocatanation 
		9. The alert actually comes up after the beginning prompt, and displays the final answer - closes out and everything
		in Script 2 is displayed 

		 */
		
		//Create prompt for number input, turn into integer and set to 'startingNumber'
		
		//entry = prompt("Enter a whole number");			
		
		var entry;			//defines 'entry' as variable


		do {
			entry = prompt("Enter a whole number");
			entry = parseInt(entry);
			var startingNumber = entry;	
			if (isNaN(entry) ) {
				alert("Must be a whole number.");
			}
		}
		while ( isNaN(entry) );


		//ATTEMPTING ISN'T FULLY CORRECT
		//if ( isNaN(entry) || entry <= 0 ) {
		//	alert ("Must be a whole number.");
		//} else if ( isNaN(entry) > 1 ) {
		//	alert("Final number is" + finalAnswer)
		//}
		//else ( isNaN(entry) || entry <=0 ) {
		//	entry = prompt("Please enter a whole number.");
		//}
		

		//if(typeof startingNumber == 'integer'){
		//	document.write(startingNumber + " is a number <br/>");
		//}else {
		//	document.write(startingNumber + " please enter a whole number <br/> ");
		//}
